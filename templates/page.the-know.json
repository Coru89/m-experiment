The plan was just to design a couple of styles and share them with family to wear on their adventures…<\/p><p>But that plan quickly changed.  After that came a wave of interest from outside the family circle. Friends began to ask if they would break out and produce more than just a few so that they could join in on the fun. This wave grew and grew.<\/p><p>It wasn’t long before Jim and Jamin found themselves calling up the best-of-the-best from their early Oakley days to be a part of the not-so-experimental-anymore experiment.<\/p><p>Where they are now involves a core team of close friends focused on dreaming up products and making them a reality—all for the fun of it.<\/p><p><\/p>",
